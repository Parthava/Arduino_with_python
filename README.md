## Communicating with Arduino through C++ and Python
The circuit diagram is simple. Pin 9 is connected to a 220 Ohm resistor and the resistor is connected to a LED and the LED is connected to the GND.

Working of the code: <br>
So normally when we communicated the Arduino board with the Arduino IDE using C++, the data is send to the board directly.
But when we use Python, C++ becomes an interpreter between the Arduino board and Python language.
The data is send through Python to the Arduino IDE in which C++ is used and finally the Arduino IDE interpretes with the Arduino board.
